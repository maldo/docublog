Hello, I'm Alberto Maldonado and this is my blog!

I have worked as a software developer for quite a few years, primarily focusing on the role of Individual Contributor, but also as an Engineering Manager leading teams and tribes.

As IC, I've worked with several languages including Java, C++, and Node.js, but Python would be my go-to programming language. However, recently, I've been showing some affection for Rust.

As an EM, I've enjoyed helping reports to progress and improve. It's a tough job, the code is 0s and 1s, but people are much more complicated. You have to know how to read them and adapt the style to each of the reports, but when a report manages to complete a project or achieve a promotion, it's a satisfaction as a manager.

In this blog, I'm going to share some of my experiences, like tackling technical problems, issues with colleagues, a bit of everything really. It's also a great opportunity for me to put my thoughts in writing and do it in English. And if this can help someone, then great.
