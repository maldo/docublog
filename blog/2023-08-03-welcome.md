Hello, I'm Alberto Maldonado and this is my blog!

I have worked as a software developer for quite a few years, primarily focusing on the role of Individual Contributor, but also as an Engineering Manager leading teams and tribes.

As an IC, I've worked with several languages including Java, C++, and Node.js, but Python would be my go-to programming language. However, recently, I've been showing some affection for Rust.
